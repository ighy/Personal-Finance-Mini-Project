### Cash Flow Analysis
Monthly net cash flow is consistently positive, with a single exception in March, which recorded a net loss of *199 BYT*. This negative month is isolated, indicating no persistent imbalance between income and expenses.

From October onward, the data shows noticeable declines in remaining account balance, signaling the onset of a higher-spending period. This pattern is consistent with seasonal expense pressure, such as end-of-year obligations or discretionary holiday spending, rather than a structural change in income.

Despite short-term volatility, the long-term trend remains stable and positive across the full 11-month period. While early-month analysis may overemphasize the March deficit, a full-period view confirms that this loss does not persist or compound, and therefore does not represent a sustained cash-flow risk.

### Cash Flow Health and Expense Dynamics
#### Expense Coverage and Frequency of Deficits
Across the 11-month observation period, expenses exceeded income in only one month (≈9%), with March recording a net cash flow deficit of 199 BYT. The infrequency and isolation of this deficit indicate that negative cash flow events are non-recurring rather than symptomatic of a persistent liquidity issue.
#### Drivers of Increased Expenses
Observed declines in remaining account balances beginning after September are driven primarily by increased spending levels, not by a deterioration in income. Income inflows remain consistently positive across recent months, while outflows increase in magnitude, suggesting a shift in expenditure behavior rather than income volatility.

#### Inflows vs Outflows, Structurally
There is no evidence of a structural imbalance between inflows and outflows. Short-term volatility, most notably the March deficit, does not compound or repeat, and aggregate net cash flow remains positive over the full period. When evaluated holistically, the account demonstrates cash flow sustainability rather than financial stress.

### Account Health
* Cash flow is highly concentrated, with Account 1 generating the majority of net inflows and accounting for most expense outflows, making it the primary driver of overall liquidity.

* Account 2 captures a meaningful share of income but supports relatively low expenses, indicating a secondary operating or transfer role.

* Accounts 4 and 5 receive small portions of income and exhibit minimal spending, consistent with savings or emergency reserve accounts.

* Account 3 is structurally unprofitable, recording approximately 64 USD in income against 1,354 USD in expenses, and therefore requires ongoing subsidization from other accounts, most likely Accounts 1 and 2.

* Overall account health is maintained through cross-account subsidization and role specialization, introducing concentration risk due to heavy reliance on Accounts 1 and 2.
